# Physical-device test results

## 2026-08-31: Samsung Galaxy A52s initial audible run

Evidence label: **HARDWARE TESTED** for the items explicitly listed below.

- Phone: Samsung Galaxy A52s (`SM-A528B`), Android 14 / API 34.
- Host: Windows 10 Pro for Workstations 22H2, build 19045.7663.
- Connection: authorized physical USB ADB device using a data cable.
- Installation: the Windows host detected the missing companion and completed
  the explicit one-time install action.
- End-to-end result: ordinary Windows audio was audibly reproduced by the phone
  speaker and was reported by the tester as working very well.
- Windows capture mode: `globalSystem`.
- Host queue at the captured diagnostic snapshot: 0 frames / 0.0 ms.
- Host queue high-water mark: 480 frames / 10.0 ms.
- Host dropped chunks: 0.
- USB heartbeat round-trip time: 10 ms.
- Android dropped frames: 0.

The permanently signed `1.0.0-rc.1` APK was then installed on the same phone.
Two authenticated 10-second screen-off protocol runs each delivered 480,000
frames with zero drops and zero underruns, `route=2` (built-in speaker),
`focus=1` (gained), the session wake lock present, and exact service/forward
cleanup. A longer strict run was invalidated when Android reported biometric
wake reason 17 and turned the panel on; targeted power-state instrumentation
attributed that wake to face/fingerprint handling rather than an AudioShare wake
request. The uninstrumented ten-minute screen-off gate remains open.

The diagnostic screenshot and tester report prove the initial real-phone
Windows capture, USB transport, companion installation, and audible playback
path on this device. They do not by themselves prove a latency percentile,
screen-off continuity, repeated reconnect recovery, memory stability, or
long-run endurance.

## 2026-08-31: RC4 playback and focus-recovery check

The permanently signed `1.0.0-rc.4` companion (version code 7) was exercised
through the authenticated ADB-forward protocol harness on the same authorized
Galaxy A52s. A 60-second stream delivered 2,880,000 frames with zero Android
drops, zero underruns, confirmed built-in-speaker route (`route=2`), gained
media focus (`focus=1`), and an active session wake lock. Stopping the harness
removed the foreground service and its exact ADB forward. A shorter 15-second
run also delivered 720,000 frames with zero drops; its two initial underruns
were not present in the longer run.

As a targeted failure test, Samsung Music was started during the protocol run.
The companion sent the terminal cause
`AudioTrack playback failed: Android audio focus was lost` back to the harness.
A separate Windows supervisor regression proves that this exact cause becomes
an actionable phone-media error without another companion launch or ADB
forward. That Windows policy assertion is automated test evidence, not a claim
that the complete Windows UI path was exercised during the Samsung Music run.

This confirms the RC4 companion's focus-error propagation on this phone and the
host's no-reconnect-loop policy in automated regression tests. It does not
prove every OEM's audio-focus policy, the complete Windows UI path, screen-off
continuity, repeated USB recovery, latency percentiles, restricted-PC behavior,
memory stability, or endurance.

## Remaining promotion gates

- Ten-minute continuous playback with the phone screen off and final diagnostics.
- Wi-Fi-disabled playback using multiple simultaneous Windows applications.
- Automatic recovery after USB unplug/replug and repeated reconnect cycling.
- At least 20 visible/audio transient measurements with median and p95 latency.
- Two-hour stream with start/end CPU, memory, latency, underrun, and drop counts.

Until those gates are recorded, releases must be marked as prereleases rather
than stable production releases.
