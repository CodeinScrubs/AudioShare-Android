# Physical-device test results

## 2026-08-31: Samsung Galaxy A52s initial audible run

Evidence label: **HARDWARE TESTED** for the items explicitly listed below.

- Phone: Samsung Galaxy A52s (`SM-A528B`), Android 14 / API 34.
- Host: Windows 10 Pro for Workstations 22H2, build 19045.7663.
- Connection: authorized physical USB ADB device using a data cable.
- Installation: the Windows host detected the missing companion and completed
  the explicit one-time install action.
- End-to-end result: ordinary Windows audio was audibly reproduced by the phone
  speaker and was reported by the tester as working very well.
- Windows capture mode: `globalSystem`.
- Host queue at the captured diagnostic snapshot: 0 frames / 0.0 ms.
- Host queue high-water mark: 480 frames / 10.0 ms.
- Host dropped chunks: 0.
- USB heartbeat round-trip time: 10 ms.
- Android dropped frames: 0.

The permanently signed `1.0.0-rc.1` APK was then installed on the same phone.
Two authenticated 10-second screen-off protocol runs each delivered 480,000
frames with zero drops and zero underruns, `route=2` (built-in speaker),
`focus=1` (gained), the session wake lock present, and exact service/forward
cleanup. A longer strict run was invalidated when Android reported biometric
wake reason 17 and turned the panel on; targeted power-state instrumentation
attributed that wake to face/fingerprint handling rather than an AudioShare wake
request. The uninstrumented ten-minute screen-off gate remains open.

The diagnostic screenshot and tester report prove the initial real-phone
Windows capture, USB transport, companion installation, and audible playback
path on this device. They do not by themselves prove a latency percentile,
screen-off continuity, repeated reconnect recovery, memory stability, or
long-run endurance.

## 2026-08-31: RC4 playback and focus-recovery check

The permanently signed `1.0.0-rc.4` companion (version code 7) was exercised
through the authenticated ADB-forward protocol harness on the same authorized
Galaxy A52s. A 60-second stream delivered 2,880,000 frames with zero Android
drops, zero underruns, confirmed built-in-speaker route (`route=2`), gained
media focus (`focus=1`), and an active session wake lock. Stopping the harness
removed the foreground service and its exact ADB forward. A shorter 15-second
run also delivered 720,000 frames with zero drops; its two initial underruns
were not present in the longer run.

As a targeted failure test, Samsung Music was started during the protocol run.
The companion sent the terminal cause
`AudioTrack playback failed: Android audio focus was lost` back to the harness.
A separate Windows supervisor regression proves that this exact cause becomes
an actionable phone-media error without another companion launch or ADB
forward. That Windows policy assertion is automated test evidence, not a claim
that the complete Windows UI path was exercised during the Samsung Music run.

This confirms the RC4 companion's focus-error propagation on this phone and the
host's no-reconnect-loop policy in automated regression tests. It does not
prove every OEM's audio-focus policy, the complete Windows UI path, screen-off
continuity, repeated USB recovery, latency percentiles, restricted-PC behavior,
memory stability, or endurance.

## 2026-09-05: RC5 preparation with the connected Galaxy A52s

The installed non-debuggable companion exactly matched the signed Android RC4
APK, SHA-256
`1212b8bfad843e3ad04ee848476f407e98a11a6fa2d571af19b2cdcae519da7b`.
No phone app update or driver/security change was performed.

Two kinds of hardware evidence were collected; neither is a Flutter UI test:

| Test | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol harness, 15 seconds | 720,000 frames; zero drops and underruns; speaker route, focus, wake lock; service and owned forward cleaned up. |
| Production Windows DLL -> ADB USB -> phone, three 30-second sessions | Real PC signal and Android playback-head progress in all sessions; zero host/Android drops; final Android underrun counts 0, 7, 7; each service/forward cleaned up. |
| Forced default fallback, Debug DLL, concurrent full build | At approximately 20 seconds, 960 Android frames were dropped (20 ms); host dropped chunks remained zero. The strict harness failed as intended. |
| Forced default fallback, optimized Release DLL, no concurrent build, 60 seconds | 2,879,040 host-captured frames; latest heartbeat reported 2,740,800 received/written frames, head 2,739,072; zero drops/underruns; service/forward cleaned up. |

Android counters above come from periodic heartbeats and therefore lag the
host's final capture snapshot. They are not a sample-exact recording or a
measurement of acoustic latency. The fallback run reported one initial capture
discontinuity. The two different fallback conditions are not a controlled proof
that Debug optimization or build load alone caused the drop.

The connected phone confirms native capture, USB delivery, and speaker-playback
progress on the development PC. It does not resolve the silent work-PC incident,
prove physical cable unplug/replug, or prove every desktop UI interaction.

## 2026-09-05: RC5 screen-off and public-download verification

A subsequent **600-second production-DLL -> USB -> phone test passed** on the
same Galaxy A52s with the locally built optimized Windows RC5 host. All 59
periodic samples reported screen-off power state, speaker route, gained audio
focus, wake lock, and advancing playback. Final host capture was 28,801,920
frames, with zero host/Android drops, zero Android underruns, zero capture
discontinuities, and a host queue high-water mark of 1,440 frames (30 ms).
The latest Android heartbeat reported 28,707,840 received/written frames and
playback head 28,697,856. The service and owned ADB forward stopped cleanly.

These are approximately ten-second power/playback samples, not continuous
screen observation, acoustic verification, a Flutter UI run, or a latency
measurement. The earlier attempt that woke the display remains a failed
screen-off attempt; this later pass does not establish that wake's cause.

The **actual public RC5 ZIP** was then downloaded anonymously, checked against
both its SHA-256 sidecar and GitHub asset digest, and extracted under a path
containing spaces. All 33 payload files passed the internal manifest verifier.
The Windows version was `3.0.0-rc.5+5`; the companion was non-debuggable version
code 7 with the expected signing certificate and exact installed APK hash.

A separate **30-second test using that downloaded production DLL** passed:
1,439,040 host-captured frames, zero drops/underruns/discontinuities, continuing
Android playback, and clean service/forward teardown. The latest heartbeat
reported 1,296,960 received/written frames and head 1,297,536. Host and Android
counters are collected asynchronously, including between Android counters;
their snapshot differences are not packet loss or acoustic latency.

Public ZIP SHA-256:
`a68846cac2dc76ca920fc4dd37aa1b13a256bf4071314fc3ebbf674b5a206995`.

Raw [screen-off samples](https://github.com/CodeinScrubs/AudioShare/blob/main/docs/evidence/2026-09-05-rc5-screen-off.json)
and [public-download samples](https://github.com/CodeinScrubs/AudioShare/blob/main/docs/evidence/2026-09-05-rc5-public-download.json)
are retained in the host repository. Windows tag/main CI, Android CI, and the
release workflow passed.

## Remaining promotion gates

- Ten-minute screen-off playback through the portable Windows UI with final
  diagnostics (the native-DLL route passed above; UI/acoustic confirmation is
  still separate).
- Wi-Fi-disabled playback using multiple simultaneous Windows applications.
- Automatic recovery after USB unplug/replug and repeated reconnect cycling.
- At least 20 visible/audio transient measurements with median and p95 latency.
- Two-hour stream with start/end CPU, memory, latency, underrun, and drop counts.

Until those gates are recorded, releases must be marked as prereleases rather
than stable production releases.
